<h1>HTML</h1>
Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for <strong>creating <u>web</u>
pages</strong> and web applications. Web browsers receive HTML documents
<br>from a web server or from local storage and render them into multimedia web pages.
HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.
<p style="margin-top:45px;">HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects, such as interactive forms, may be embedded
into the rendered oage. It provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs,
lists, links,</p>
<br>quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets.
